# TensorBoard Lite

A lightweight [TensorBoard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) client for Android and iOS created using the [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) mobile SDK.

It currently only supports the display of scalar and pr-curve summaries and is still in very early stages.

The TensorBoard endpoint and basic auth credentials can be specifeid via the settings icon in the top right.
